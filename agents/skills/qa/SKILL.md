description: Interactive QA session where the user reports bugs or issues conversationally, and the agent writes durable markdown reports under the project's docs directory. Explores the codebase in the background for context and domain language. Use when the user wants to report bugs, do QA, capture findings in writing, or mentions "QA session".

# QA Session

Run an interactive QA session. The user describes problems they're encountering. You clarify, explore the codebase for context, and write markdown reports that are durable, user-focused, and use the project's domain language.

**Output location:** Save reports under `docs/qa/` in this repository (create the directory if it does not exist). Use sequential four-digit filenames: scan `docs/qa/` for the highest existing `NNNN-*.md` number and increment by one (e.g. `0001-form-validation.md`, `0002-success-message.md`).

## For each finding the user raises

### 1. Listen and lightly clarify

Let the user describe the problem in their own words. Ask **at most 2-3 short clarifying questions** focused on:

- What they expected vs what actually happened
- Steps to reproduce (if not obvious)
- Whether it's consistent or intermittent

Do NOT over-interview. If the description is clear enough to write up, move on.

### 2. Explore the codebase in the background

While talking to the user, kick off an Agent (subagent_type=Explore) in the background to understand the relevant area. The goal is NOT to find a fix — it's to:

- Learn the domain language used in that area (check UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md)
- Understand what the feature is supposed to do
- Identify the user-facing behavior boundary

This context helps you write a better report — but the report itself should NOT reference specific files, line numbers, or internal implementation details.

### 3. Assess scope: single report or breakdown?

Before writing, decide whether this is a **single markdown report** or needs to be **broken down** into multiple reports.

Break down when:

- The fix spans multiple independent areas (e.g. "the form validation is wrong AND the success message is missing AND the redirect is broken")
- There are clearly separable concerns that different people could work on in parallel
- The user describes something that has multiple distinct failure modes or symptoms

Keep as a single report when:

- It's one behavior that's wrong in one place
- The symptoms are all caused by the same root behavior

### 4. Write the markdown report(s)

Create the file(s) under `docs/qa/` as described above. Do NOT ask the user to review the draft before saving — write the file, then tell them the path.

Reports must be **durable** — they should still make sense after major refactors. Write from the user's perspective.

#### For a single report

Use this template:

```md
# {Short title}

## What happened

[Describe the actual behavior the user experienced, in plain language]

## What I expected

[Describe the expected behavior]

## Steps to reproduce

1. [Concrete, numbered steps a developer can follow]
2. [Use domain terms from the codebase, not internal module names]
3. [Include relevant inputs, flags, or configuration]

## Additional context

[Any extra observations from the user or from codebase exploration that help frame the finding — e.g. "this only happens when using the Docker layer, not the filesystem layer" — use domain language but don't cite files]
```

#### For a breakdown (multiple reports)

Create reports in dependency order (blockers first) so you can reference real filenames in "Blocked by".

Use this template for each sub-report:

```md
# {Short title for this slice}

## Parent tracking

Link to a parent summary file if you created one (e.g. `[QA session summary](./0000-qa-session-summary.md)`) or write "Reported during QA session".

## What's wrong

[Describe this specific behavior problem — just this slice, not the whole report]

## What I expected

[Expected behavior for this specific slice]

## Steps to reproduce

1. [Steps specific to THIS finding]

## Blocked by

- [](./NNNN-other-report.md) — brief reason (if this can't be addressed until another report is resolved)

Or **None — can start immediately** if no blockers.

## Additional context

[Any extra observations relevant to this slice]
```

When creating a breakdown:

- **Prefer many thin reports over few thick ones** — each should be independently fixable and verifiable
- **Mark blocking relationships honestly** — if report B genuinely can't be tested until report A is fixed, say so. If they're independent, mark both as "None — can start immediately"
- **Create reports in dependency order** so you can reference real paths in "Blocked by"
- **Maximize parallelism** — the goal is that multiple people (or agents) can pick up different reports simultaneously

Optional: add a short index file `docs/qa/0000-qa-session-YYYY-MM-DD.md` listing each report path and one-line summary when the session produces many files.

#### Rules for all report bodies

- **No file paths or line numbers** — these go stale
- **Use the project's domain language** (check UBIQUITOUS_LANGUAGE.md if it exists)
- **Describe behaviors, not code** — "the sync service fails to apply the patch" not "applyPatch() throws on line 42"
- **Reproduction steps are mandatory** — if you can't determine them, ask the user
- **Keep it concise** — a developer should be able to read the report in 30 seconds

After saving, print the relative path(s) to each file (with blocking relationships summarized) and ask: "Next finding, or are we done?"

### 5. Continue the session

Keep going until the user says they're done. Each finding is independent — don't batch them.
